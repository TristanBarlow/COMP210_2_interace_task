# Dont Drop The Cargo
The game I will implement my interface for will be very simple. You will be standing in a 3D environment and there will be objects that are flying at you. In this game, you will be trying to transport a piece of cargo to a new location without having it break from the flying objects coming your way. To achieve this I will attach a Vive tracker to a random object in the room, which will then become the precious cargo. By attaching the Vive tracker to real objects player to physically hold something with mass, I believe this will help in immersing the player into the game.
