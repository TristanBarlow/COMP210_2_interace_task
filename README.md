# Don't Drop The Cargo

The game I will implement my interface for will be very simple. You will be standing in a 3D environment and there will be objects that are flying at you. In this game, you will be trying to transport a piece of cargo to new locations, Having it break from the flying objects coming your way will result in losing one of your "lives". To achieve this I will attach a Vive tracker to a random object in the room, which will then become the precious cargo. The player will only move a few steps to the left and right. The player will gain score passively, depending on time there may be multipliers in the game to add an extra dynamic. 



# Market

From the market research I have done, there seem to be no games currently out for VR that have a similar concept. As VR becomes more accessible to the general public I believe more games will appear. I think provided I make the interface smooth and easy to navigate the competition such games inspire may prove Don't Drop The Cargo to be popular. From the game superhot I noticed that my peers and myself had the most fun when playing endless mode seeking to beat the current high score. I hope to emulate this kind of challenge.



# Design

By attaching the Vive tracker to real objects the player will physically hold something with mass, I believe this will help in immersing the player into the game. This may also provide a small amount of workout for the player if the object the tracker is attached to has significant mass. Dependent on time I may add motors to provide physical feedback when hit.
